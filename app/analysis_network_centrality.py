PART 1: NETWORK CENTRALITY METRICS

Using the imbd_movies dataset
- Guild a graph and perform some rudimentary graph analysis, extracting centrality metrics from it. 
- Below is some basic code scaffolding that you will need to add to. 
- Tailor this code scaffolding and its stucture to however works to answer the problem
- Make sure the code is line with the standards we're using in this class

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
import json

# Build the graph
g = nx.Graph()

# Set up your dataframe(s) -> the df that's output to a CSV should include at least the columns 'left_actor_name', '<->', 'right_actor_name'

with open() as in_file:
    # Don't forget to comment your code
    for line in in_file:
        # Don't forget to include docstrings for all functions

        # Load the movie from this line
        this_movie = json.loads(line)
            
        # Create a node for every actor
        for actor_id,actor_name in this_movie['actors']:
        # add the actor to the graph    
        # Iterate through the list of actors, generating all pairs
        ## Starting with the first actor in the list, generate pairs with all subsequent actors
        ## then continue to second actor in the list and repeat
            break
       
        i = 0 #counter
        for left_actor_id,left_actor_name in this_movie['actors']:
            for right_actor_id,right_actor_name in this_movie['actors'][i+1:]:

                # Get the current weight, if it exists
                
                
                # Add an edge for these actors
                
                
                
                i += 1 

# Print the info below
print("Nodes:", len(g.nodes))

#Print the 10 the most central nodes


# Output the final dataframe to a CSV named 'network_centrality_{current_datetime}.csv' to `/data`
